About
=====

This is a complete rewrite of Sculptdroid using Unreal Engine 4. There were performance issues and
strange hiccups as a result of Javascript compilation for mobile. The original Javascript source code is still in another branch but once features have eventually caught up, this will overwrite the master.


Building
=====
### Requirements
- Unreal Engine 4.23
- Visual Studio 2017 (or platform respective C++ compiler/IDE)

### Optional
- Android build capability ([UE4 Docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/Mobile/Android/GettingStarted/index.html))
